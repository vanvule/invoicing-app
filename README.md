# The Frontend Homework

As part of our application process, we'd like to see what you can produce by giving you a small assignment. It should take you no more than a few hours to complete the assignment, but any extra polish or features you might want to put in will not go unnoticed.

## The assignment

![](assets/create-invoice.png)

![](assets/list-invoice.png)

We would like you to create an invoicing app. The features it should include:

 - [ ] Create a new invoice
 - [ ] Add line items to the invoice. 
   Line items may item name, quantity, unit, unit price, calculated price, etc.
 - [ ] Add notes to the invoice, including possibly how to pay it, where to send checks, etc.
 - [ ] Send the invoice via email (does not have to actually send emails, but if it does, great!)
 - [ ] View invoices including status (paid, outstanding, late, etc.)

Your backend can be anything, and does not have to work. If you would like to use a mocked-out interface, that is fine (even static data in code is ok).

You can use design materials from this source: [Behance](https://www.behance.net/gallery/190762531/Microinvoice-UIUX-Case-Study)

#### Extra credit features

 - [ ] Add a due date to an invoice
 - [ ] View late invoices, or even better, alert when an invoice is late
-  [ ] Add filters for listing page
 - [ ] Polish and UX
 - [ ] Highly reusable components
 - [ ] Tests
